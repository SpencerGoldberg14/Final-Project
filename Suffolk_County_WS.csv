Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

With abundant low level moisture and cold air in place, light intermittent precipitation occurred Saturday.  As the low intensified, heavy precipitation developed and moved northeast across the area. 

Heavy snow occurred across Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and northern Westchester counties. 

In the New York City area, southern Westchester County, and across Nassau County, a period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, producing ice accumulations of up to 0.20 inches.  This buildup of ice on major highways and bridges produced hazardous travel conditions Saturday night, and contributed to an airplane skidding off the runway at JFK Airport Sunday morning. The sleet and freezing rain changed to heavy snow early Sunday morning. 
 
Across Suffolk County, a significant period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, before changing to heavy snow early Sunday morning.  Ice accumulations ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 inches.  This accretion of ice on tree limbs caused some tree branches to fall, and led to power outages. 

Here are some specific snowfall and ice amounts for:

Orange County:  from 5 inches at Newburgh to 7 inches measured at Chester.

Putnam County:  8.1 inches measured at Fahnestock State Park.

Rockland County:  6 inches measured at Pomona.

Westchester County:  from 5 inches at Yorktown Heights to 7.3 inches measured at White Plains.

New York City:

This storm was accompanied by a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain through the early portion of the event, and mainly heavy snow for the remainder of the event. Gusty winds and minor to moderate coastal flooding and beach erosion also occurred along coastal portions of Long Island.

On Sunday March 4th, a strong low pressure system moved east across the Tennessee Valley, while a new low slowly developed off the Mid Atlantic coast. The precipitation shield accompanying this complex storm system moved north and reached southeast New York in the form of spotty light snow and sleet by Sunday afternoon. The precipitation intensified Sunday night and early Monday, but as warmer air moved into the region aloft, the snow changed to a mixture of sleet, freezing rain and rain by Monday morning along coastal sections. Some portions of interior southeast New York received several inches of snow from this initial surge of precipitation.

During Monday March 5th, the new low pressure system off the Mid Atlantic coast began to intensify rapidly. This spread heavy precipitation across eastern Long Island from the east by Monday afternoon and evening. As colder air was drawn into the storm's circulation, the precipitation changed to heavy wet snow by Monday evening across eastern Long Island. Snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour for at least 3 hours were common across most of Suffolk County through the early portion of Monday night. This heavier snow also began to move west, spreading across western Long Island and the New York City area later Monday night into Tuesday.

Bands of moderate to heavy wet snow continued into Tuesday across much of southeast New York, extending back into interior sections as the low slowly drifted north off the eastern end of Long Island. This coastal low then became nearly stationary during Tuesday, and even retrograded slightly to the southwest during Tuesday afternoon. This prolonged the  periods of moderate to heavy wet snow across most of southeast New York into the late afternoon hours on Tuesday. The storm finally began to retreat east off the New Jersey coast Tuesday night and Wednesday, allowing the snow to taper off and end by early Wednesday morning on March 7th.

The combination of very heavy wet snow and strong winds with this prolonged coastal storm produced scattered power outages across southeast New York, primarily across Suffolk County. In addition, many schools and businesses were closed for several days due to the hazardous nature of this storm. 

Here are some storm total snowfall amounts:

For Orange County: 6 inches at Middletown, to 13 inches at Monroe and Tuxedo Park.

For Putnam County: 6 inches at Carmel, to 14 inches at Mahopac.

For Rockland County: 4.5 inches at Valley Cottage, to 7.6 inches at Stony Point.
