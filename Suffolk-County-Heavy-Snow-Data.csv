With cold air in place,  a low pressure system developed over the Gulf Coast States on Saturday, March 13th.  As the low slowly intensified and moved northeast toward the Mid-Atlantic Coast, it spread precipitation northeast across the area.  Light rain quickly changed to wet snow during the afternoon of March 14th.  The wet snow became heavy overnight as the low approached the Mid-Atlantic States.  Snowfall amounts generally ranged from 6 to 11 inches across the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island.  Heavy wet snow downed many tree limbs and power lines across the region.

A low pressure system rapidly intensified and moved north along the mid Atlantic coast during Saturday December 30th. This produced a wide swath of heavy snow to the northwest of the storm track. Snowfall began between 5 and 7 AM across the area, and fell at intense rates right from the start. Snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. There were also numerous reports of thunder and lightning accompanying the most intense snow bands. Winds also began to increase later Saturday morning, causing some blowing and drifting of snow, which reduced visibilities significantly, and created near blizzard conditions at times in some areas. 

As the low pressure center approached the south shore of Suffolk county early Saturday afternoon, milder air from the Atlantic Ocean wrapped into the storm system, and changed the heavy snow to a mixture of sleet and rain across eastern Suffolk county. This limited snowfall amounts somewhat across eastern Suffolk County.

The low pressure center crossed central Suffolk County during mid afternoon on Saturday, before moving northeast into southern New England later that evening. As the low moved away, the precipitation tapered off across the area. Subfreezing temperatures and gusty winds lingered behind the storm system.

Here are some specific snowfall totals from this storm system:

Orange County: 14 inches at Harriman, to 21 inches at Warwick and Rock Tavern.

Putnam County: 13 inches at Carmel and Brewster.

Rockland County: 15 inches at Airmont, to 18 inches at Suffern.

Westchester County: 13 inches at Mount Kisco, to 16.5 inches at Mamaroneck.

Bronx County: 11 inches.

On Monday February 5th, a developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast moved northeast to a position off eastern Long Island by Monday evening. The storm then moved off the New England coast by early Tuesday. The storm spread a swath of rain and wet snow across southeast New York during early Monday. As the low rapidly intensified, colder air was entrained into the storm system. This changed the rain into heavy wet snow by early Monday afternoon across central and eastern Long Island. In addition, another band of heavy wet snow affected portions of the lower Hudson Valley through the afternoon hours.  This second band of snow then moved east and produced additional snow across portions of the New York City area and Long Island into Monday evening, before the snow tapered off from west to east during Monday night.

Due to the rapid rate at which the snow fell, hazardous travel resulted across much of the New York City area and Long Island for the Monday evening commute. 

Here are some specific snowfall totals for this snow event:

For Orange County: 12 inches at Walden and Newburgh, to 22 inches at Monroe.

On Wednesday, December 4th, an area of low pressure started to develop along an old frontal boundary that snaked across the northwest Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf coast states.  Meanwhile, high pressure stretched from the northern plains, across the Great Lakes, to the Mid-Atlantic coast.  This high pressure locked in the cold air across the northeast United States.  That night, the developing storm moved across the southeastern states to the North Carolina coast.  Shortly after daybreak on the morning of Thursday, December 5th, as the storm started to move off the coast near Cape Hatteras, flurries and light snow started to move into New York City and the lower Hudson Valley. By 9 am, snow had started to fall across western Long Island and Westchester County, and bands of moderate to heavy snow had started to move into New York City and the lower Hudson Valley. An hour later, snow began to fall across the eastern end of Long Island, and the snow had become heavy over the western end of Long Island and Westchester.  By 11 am, a moderate to, at times, heavy snow had spread across the entire region. This steady, moderate to heavy snow continued through most of the afternoon, falling at times at rates over an inch per hour.  As the storm sped off toward the North Atlantic waters, the heavy snow began to taper off to light snow between 4 pm and 5:30 pm.  By this time, an average of 5 to 7 inches had fallen across the New York Metropolitan area,  Long Island and most of the lower Hudson Valley and as much as 6 to 9 inches in Orange county.  As moisture continued to "wrap around" the storm, light snow continued to fall through the evening rush hour commute before tapering off to flurries and finally ending between 8 pm and 9 pm in New York City, Westchester, the lower Hudson Valley and western Long Island.  Across the east end of Long Island, light snow lingered until shortly before midnight. Final snowfall accumulations ranged from 6 to 8 inches in New York City, Long Island and the nearby northern suburbs. Further north, in portions of Orange and northwest Putnam counties, where heavier snow bands had moved across, final snowfall totals ranged from 7 to 10 inches.",28

On Tuesday, December 24th, an area of low pressure began to develop over the Gulf coast states.  That night, the storm intensified as it moved northeast, reaching the Virginia coastline by daybreak on December 25th.  Around this time, spotty drizzle and light rain began to overspread the New York Metropolitan area and Long Island, while light freezing rain and freezing drizzle started to fall across the lower Hudson Valley.  As the morning progressed, the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast.  As a result, a steady rain developed over New York City and Long Island, while freezing rain began to mix with sleet and snow in the lower Hudson Valley.  As the storm started to move east of the tri-state area, winds shifted from the east and northeast to the north or northwest. This allowed colder air to slowly infiltrate southeastern New York.  The wintry mix changed to snow in the lower Hudson Valley during the early afternoon, and the rain changed to snow during the mid afternoon in New York City and during the late afternoon across all of Long Island except for the twin forks region where the rain did not change to snow until that evening.  During the late afternoon and early evening, narrow bands of heavy snow developed and moved over parts of the region, which resulted in large ranges of snowfall with this storm.  As the center of the storm continued to move northeast away from the area, the snow then tapered off to light snow and flurries overnight, ending shortly after midnight in the lower Hudson Valley and New York City, and from west to east between about 2 am and 4 am across Long Island.  Snowfall amounts in Orange and Putnam counties ranged from 10 to 20 inches, 6 to 12 inches fell in Rockland and Westchester counties, and 3 to 6 inches in New York City, except for an area across the eastern Bronx and northeastern Queens, where 6 to 10 inches fell.  On Long Island, 6 to 12 inches fell in Nassau and Western Suffolk counties, while across eastern Suffolk amounts ranged from less than an inch across the twin forks to 2 to 4 inches just west of Riverhead. The wide ranges of snowfall were generally due to narrow banding of heavy snow, but across Long Island the timing of the change from rain to snow also accounted for the pronounced differential of snow received.",32

Periods of light snow developed as northeast winds increased to around 15 mph across the NYC Metro area Sunday afternoon, February 16th.  Snow became widespread and heavy, falling at rates up to 2 to 3 inches per hour Sunday night and Monday, February 17th.  Heavy snow blown by northeast winds 20 to 30 mph caused near blizzard conditions throughout the area.  Record heavy snowfalls crippled mass transit.  These extremely hazardous weather conditions led to local emergency declarations throughout the region.

A weak low pressure system formed over the Ohio River Valley along a pre-existing and nearly stationary frontal boundary on Wednesday, March 5th. That night this storm started to move east, and passed just south of the New York City Metropolitan area and Long Island on Thursday, March 6th. Meanwhile, an area of strengthening High Pressure started to build down from southern Canada. This created a north to northeast flow, which allowed rain and sleet at the onset of precipitation to quickly turn to snow, which remained the precipitation type for the duration of the storm.

Meanwhile, an area of strengthening High Pressure started to build down from southern Canada. This created a north to northeast flow, which allowed rain and sleet at the onset of precipitation to quickly turn to snow, which remained the precipitation type for the duration of the storm. Snowfall amounts for this late winter storm were as follows:

Orange County: 7 to 10 inches, including 7.0 inches at Newburgh and 8.0 inches in Monroe.

Putnam County: 5 to 7 inches, including 6.5 inches in Brewster.

Rockland County: 5 to 7 inches.

As a cold high pressure system settled over New England, a series of low pressure systems developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Friday, December 5th and Saturday, December 6th.

The first low pressure system developed along the North Carolina Coast during Friday morning.  As this low moved northeast, it intensified.  Light snow developed and quickly spread northeast across the area during the morning.  Snowfall became heavy across the NYC Metro Area, Long Island, and Southern Westchester County during the afternoon. Between 7 and 10 pm that evening, a 6 to 10 inch snowfall occurred across this area.  There were major impacts to mass transit operations during the evening's "rush" hours.  As this low moved southeast of Long Island, snowfall intensity decreased and became light across the region.

The second low pressure system developed further north and west along the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday morning.  As this low rapidly intensified, it moved slowly northeast.  Light snow became heavy across the entire region by early afternoon.  Blizzard conditions developed from Queens County east across Suffolk County between 1 pm and 6 pm.  Wind gusts of at least 35 mph combined with heavy falling snow created "white out" conditions that reduced visibility to less than 1/4 mile.  Major widespread impacts to mass transit occurred across the entire region.

Storm Total Snowfall amounts for this 2 day episode ranged from 6 to 25 inches.  Most snowfall accumulations were between 10 and 15 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

New York County - from 14.0 inches at Central Park Zoo to 17.8 inches at Bryant Park.

Bronx County - 15.9 inches was measured at Parkchester

Queens County - from 11 inches at Richmond Hill to 13.1 inches at LaGuardia Airport.  At John F. Kennedy Airport, 12.7 inches was measured.

With cold air in place, as an Alberta Clipper moved southeast across the Ohio Valley, it weakened and redeveloped off the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday, January 22nd.  This low rapidly intensified as it moved south of Long Island Saturday night and offshore Sunday.  These systems produced near blizzard conditions with heavy snow, strong and gusty winds, blowing snow, and drifting snow.  Widespread moderate beach erosion and minor tidal flooding occurred across the Atlantic Ocean shores and east end from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning, January 23rd.

Light snow spread northeast across the region between 11 am and 1 pm, although patches of light snow occurred across the twin forks of Long Island between 9 am and 10 am.  It quickly became heavy, falling at a rate of at least 1 inch per hour, between 1 pm and 3 pm and lasted until between 7 pm and 11 pm.  Across the Lower Hudson Valley, temperatures rose from the single digits into the teens as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.  Across New York City and Long Island, temperatures rose from the teens into the 20s as northeast winds increased up to 20 to 30 mph during this time.  Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 50 mph.  A few peak gusts near 65 mph occurred across the twin forks of Long Island.  Peak gusts at Shinnecock Inlet and Orient Point were measured at 64 and 63 mph, respectively.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.

Storm total snowfalls ranged from around 7 to 20 inches across the region.  Most locations measured between 8 and 16 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

Orange County - from 8.0 inches at Campbell Hall to 15.0 inches at Highland Mills.

Putnam County - from 8.0 inches at Kent Cliffs to 12.0 inches at Mahopac.

Rockland County - from 8.5 inches at Monsey to 10.8 inches at New City.

Nassau County - from 11.3 inches at Great Neck to 16.5 inches at Farmingdale.

Suffolk County - from 10.4 inches at Shirley to 19.5 inches at Baiting Hollow and Lake Ronkonkoma.  The NWS Upton Office measured 17.5 inches.  At Islip Airport, 15.1 inches of snow was measured.

Concerning coastal flooding, pockets of moderate flooding occurred across Eastern Long Island.

With cold air in place, as an Alberta Clipper moved southeast across the Ohio Valley, it weakened and redeveloped off the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday, January 22nd.  This low rapidly intensified as it moved south of Long Island Saturday night and offshore Sunday.  These systems produced near blizzard conditions with heavy snow, strong and gusty winds, blowing snow, and drifting snow.  Widespread moderate beach erosion and minor tidal flooding occurred across the Atlantic Ocean shores and east end from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning, January 23rd.

Light snow spread northeast across the region between 11 am and 1 pm, although patches of light snow occurred across the twin forks of Long Island between 9 am and 10 am.  It quickly became heavy, falling at a rate of at least 1 inch per hour, between 1 pm and 3 pm and lasted until between 7 pm and 11 pm.  Across the Lower Hudson Valley, temperatures rose from the single digits into the teens as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.  Across New York City and Long Island, temperatures rose from the teens into the 20s as northeast winds increased up to 20 to 30 mph during this time.  Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 50 mph.  A few peak gusts near 65 mph occurred across the twin forks of Long Island.  Peak gusts at Shinnecock Inlet and Orient Point were measured at 64 and 63 mph, respectively.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.

Storm total snowfalls ranged from around 7 to 20 inches across the region.  Most locations measured between 8 and 16 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

Orange County - from 8.0 inches at Campbell Hall to 15.0 inches at Highland Mills.

Putnam County - from 8.0 inches at Kent Cliffs to 12.0 inches at Mahopac.

The snow fell steadily and heavily at times in many areas overnight Saturday and into Sunday morning, until the last band of heavy snow swept east of Long Island late Sunday afternoon.

During the event, many areas experienced very heavy snowfall rates, up to 3 to 4 inches per hour.  As the strongest band of snow moved through the lower Hudson Valley and New York City, reports of "thundersnow" were received, which supported the very intense snowfall rates.
